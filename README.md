!["You touch it and I'll stick this blade in your gut!"](http://pm1.narvii.com/6880/d10210dd82032ac01b2cdf7e97f5bb46408f493br1-1260-516v2_uhq.jpg)

Gorbag is an orc in The Lord of the Rings. It's also what I'm calling this repo which is a mock of a possible take on our new API ORChestrator...

To run, pull down the repo, run `npm install` and then `npm start`. Server will be listening on `localhost:4000`.

Graphiql can be accessed by visiting http://localhost:4000/ once the server is running, and there is an Apollo Studio setup for this project that looks for the server at that same address which can be accessed at https://studio.apollographql.com/graph/gorbag. You may need to be added as a consumer there, so let me know if you want to be granted access to that.
